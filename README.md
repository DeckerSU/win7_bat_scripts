## What is this? ##

[win7_bat_scripts](https://github.com/DeckerSU/win7_bat_scripts) is a repository containing several useful batch scripts (or simply `.bat` files) for Windows 7 / 8 / 10 that allow you to automate a number of routine operations after installing the OS.

- **disable_gwx.cmd** – helps disable the intrusive system tray notification in early Windows versions (i.e. Win7 and Win8) about the need to upgrade to Windows 10.
- **win7_desktop_icons.cmd** – as you may know, in newer versions of Windows the familiar desktop icons from Windows XP, such as Computer, Network, Control Panel, etc., are disabled by default. This file lets you enable them with a single click via the Windows interface. In other words, the script quickly launches the “Desktop Icon Settings” menu.
- **win7_keyb_layout.cmd** – sets the keyboard layout switch shortcut to Ctrl + Shift, applying the change for both the current user and all system users. Handy for anyone who’s always wanted the keyboard to switch with Ctrl + Shift even on the welcome screen.
- **win7_godmode.cmd** – creates a shortcut to the well-known God Mode in Windows 7 on the current user’s desktop.
